NLP( ML > DL > AI)

The domains of NLP like speech recognition, sentiment analysis, speech tagging, then word senses, natural language generation and others.

Tokenization- the process of splitting a paragraph, string or text into words or sentences.

Preprocessing- The process of converting a data into something that computer can understand is called preprocessing.
So one of the major forms of preprocessing is filtering out that part of the data, which doesn't carries any information.
Or we can say that part of the data which is considered as redundant.

Stop Words- in natural language processing, the redundant words or the redundant data is referred as stopwords.

Stemming is the process of mapping group of words together to the same step.

Lamenting - lamenting is the process of mapping group of words and ensuring that it belongs to a particular language and a citation.



Day 1 Part 1 Hands on Exercise: 
 
1.  **Word Tokenization**: Write a Python function that takes a sentence as input and uses the `word_tokenize` function from the `nltk` library to tokenize the sentence into words. Print the list of tokens.
 
2. **Sentence Tokenization**: Write a Python function that takes a paragraph as input and uses the `sent_tokenize` function from the `nltk` library to tokenize the paragraph into sentences. Print the list of sentences.
 
3. **Stopwords Removal**: Write a Python function that takes a sentence as input, removes stopwords using the `stopwords` corpus from the `nltk` library, and prints the sentence without stopwords.
 
4. **Frequency Distribution**: Write a Python function that takes a text as input, calculates the frequency distribution of words using the `FreqDist` class from the `nltk` library, and prints the top 5 most common words and their frequencies.
 
5. **Word Cloud**: Write a Python script that reads a text file, uses the `WordCloud` library to generate a word cloud from the text, and displays the word cloud image.
